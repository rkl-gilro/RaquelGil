I am a research scientist in computational colour at Justus-Liebig Universit√§t Giessen. 

In my research career, I acquired experience in colour related problems, like colour stabilisation, HDR imaging, demosaicing, colour constancy, display calibration, etc. 

Currently, I am involved in a multidisciplinary project. We focus on virtual environment calibration for colour vision experiments.
