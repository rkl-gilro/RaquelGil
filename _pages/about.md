I am a research scientist in computational colour at the Psychology Department, Justus-Liebig Universit√§t, Giessen. 

I always wonder: Why cameras do not capture the world as we perceive it?
That question I tried to answer during my PhD.  For that, I focused on the colour processing pipeline of the cameras.

One of the reasons is the limited dynamic range that the sensor can capture. High dynamic range imaging is a challenging topic in the cinema industry, professional cameras should reach high standards. 
But still, cameras lack the adaptability of our eyes. 
My suggestion would be ... consider always working with RAW!

If we think about colour, why the same camera models do not capture/present the same colours? And what if we want to achieve the same professional standards working with a DSLR camera? Colour matching techniques can help us bring the image set to a reference colour space.

Now I am working to understand the way we perceive the world, especially colour. I believe virtual reality is the perfect tool for studying that. We cannot change the physics of our environment, but we can do it easily in virtual reality!
