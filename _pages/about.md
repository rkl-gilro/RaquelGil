I am a researcher in computational colour at Justus-Liebig Universit√§t Giessen. 

I have experience in a large num-ber of colour related problems ranging from colour stabilisation to HDR imaging, de-mosaicking, colour constancy, and colorcalibration. 

Currently, I am involved ina multi-disciplinary project in which we focus on how to colour calibrate virtual environments for colour constancy experiments.
