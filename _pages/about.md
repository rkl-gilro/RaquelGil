I am a researcher in computational colour at Justus-Liebig Universit√§t Giessen. 

I have experience in a large number of colour related problems ranging from colour stabilisation to HDR imaging, demosaicking, colour constancy, and colour calibration. 

Currently, I am involved in a multidisciplinary project in which we focus on how to colour calibrate virtual environments for colour constancy experiments.
